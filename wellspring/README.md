-An assumption was made that empty data could be left empty(I considered using "TBD" or "n/a" but decided I would not)

Notes:
    - Uploading files saves them permanently in the uploads folder. Currently there is no timed auto-delete for them.  
        I initially had the uploads vanish after use, but decided to have both functionality in the case it was desired
    - Two extra csv files are provided in the zip that I used for basic testing.
